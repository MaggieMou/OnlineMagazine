    <div class="tadasana_instructions">
        <p> You’re traveling through the snowy mountains. </p>
        <p>You’re dressed for the weather, so you don’t feel cold. </p>
        <p>As you go, you notice there’s a yoga mat with some accessories. </p>
        <p>“We’ll… That’s unusual “ you think to yourself, but yet the mat looks very inviting. </p>
        <p>Now, I’d like to ask you to stand on the mat, connect your feet and press them down to the mat. </p>
        <p>As you are in the mountains, you have the chance to become one. Let’s get into the mountain pose - tadasana.
        </p>
        <p>Point your calves towards your heels, flex your thighs, Raise your kneecaps upwards, point your upper
            buttocks downwards, lift your pubis up and move your breastbone away from the pubis. </p>
        <p>Rotate the arms outward, leave the arms rotated, and turn the palms upside down.</p>
        <p>Long neck, soft throat, soft gaze at eye level, top of your head reaching to the sky.</p>
        <p>Lengthen your spine with your tailbone down and the top of your head up.</p>
        <p>Tadasana pose, the mountain pose, it is a pose that is stable - direct your attention to your feet and
            distribute your weight evenly over both feet.</p>
        <p>Feel that you are standing steadily on both feet as you lengthen and expand your chest evenly, moving your
            breasts apart.</p>
        <p>And as you stand in the mountain pose,</p>
        <p>you feel as if you become one.</p>
        <p>With your head up in the sky, you can feel how the temperature is much lower up high and higher on your
            roots. </p>
        <p>The entire ecosystem of the mountain is pulsing within your blood.</p>
        <p>You’re connected to all of the living creatures that live on that mountain that is you.</p>
        <p>And as you relax into that feeling, you can hear a subtle voice from the distance.</p>
        <p>It’s the other mountains calling you.</p>
        <p>As you listen to the voice it’s becoming clearer and clearer…</p><br>
        <p>“Dear traveler… We have an important message for you. Your calling and your destiny is to be a warrior.
            There’s going to be an intruder here, that’s going to put many lives at risk and you must defeat them. “</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shocked by the message you just received there’s many questions in your mind - </p>
        <p>did I actually just become a mountain? Was it just a hallucination, or did I actually hear what I heard? Will
            I listen to the mountains and become a warrior, or will I stop this recording and do something else? </p>
        <p>The choice is yours, Traveler. </p><br>
        <p>The mountains are counting on you. </p><br>

        <p>So you have chosen to listen to the mountains.</p>
        <p>Very well, traveler, let’s get you into the warrior pose then. </p>
        <p>Standing in Tadasana, on your inhale bring your palms in front of you, on the exhale spread your arms to the
            sides and make a wide stride, at least 1 meter, and if you can, position your foot so that your ankles are
            under your wrists.</p>
        <p>Twist one foot inwards with the toes outwards, and twist the other foot outwards with the heel.</p>
        <p>Point your hips and chest forward.</p>
        <p>Now, on an exhale, slowly bend your knee and lower your hips down.</p>
        <p>Do not bend down towards the bent leg, leave the weight of the body on the straight leg,</p>
        <p>and go down with your hips until you have a 90 degree angle at the knee.</p>
        <p>The knee goes to the side and the knee lines up above your heel.</p>
        <p>If you have a healthy cervical spine and you can twist your head, slowly turn your head towards the bent leg.
        </p>
        <p>Breathe, lengthen your spine, widen your chest, keep your hands apart, pushing them away from each other,</p>
        <p>on the exhale, turn your head inward.</p>
        <p>While inhaling, straighten the leg, feet parallel.</p>
        <p>And to the other side.</p>
        <p>Twist the other heel inward with the toes outwards and the heel of the other leg outwards.</p>
        <p>Hips forward, chest forward.</p>
        <p>Parallel to this long edge of the mat.</p>
        <p>Now you go down bending the second knee.</p>
        <p>Bend your leg to a 90 degree angle</p>
        <p>and turn your head towards the bent leg.</p>
        <p>Hands at the level of your shoulders, breathe</p>
        <p>chest and hips parallel to the long edge of the mat</p>
        <p>body weight on a straight leg</p>
        <p>feet pressed against the mat, the outer edge of the straight leg is also pressed against the mat.</p>
        <p>Exhale.</p>
        <p>The head is the center.</p>
        <p>Breathe in your legs up your feet parallel, hands on your hips and slowly go back in small steps.</p>
        <p>Heel, toes, heel, toes, heel, toes…</p><br>
        <p>You became a warrior.</p><br>

        <p>You feel yourself as a strong warrior, ready to fight for the creatures of the mountains. </p>
        <p>You take a deep breath preparing yourself for your fight, but you notice something approaching you from the
            distance. </p>
        <p>As it comes closer you recognize it’s a butterfly </p>
        <p>How did it got into this snowy area? You have no idea, but the butterfly looks incredibly beautiful, almost
            magical. It’s wings have a deep navy shade with some lighter blue kaleidoscopic ornaments. </p>
        <p>You look at its beauty and to connect with it we’re going to get into a butterfly pose. </p>
        <p>Sit on the mat and bring your feet together in front of you.</p>
        <p>If your knees go too far up and your spine leans forward, then you have to sit higher - you can use a block
            or a folded blanket to sit on.</p>
        <p>Sit down so that your sciatic bumps are exactly on the block, connect your feet and bring them as close as
            possible to the perineum.</p>
        <p>Press your feet together.</p>
        <p>Now put 2 fingers on your big toe, tighten and press with your thumb, </p>
        <p>straighten your spine, push your shoulders to the back and with each exhale, press the outer edges of your
            feet against the mat while lifting the sternum, slowly lower your knees down</p>
        <p>relax your groin, extend the inner edges of your thighs, from your groin to your knees, and breathe</p>

        <p>As you’re looking at the butterfly slowly flying away towards the mountains you return to the state of
            awareness. </p><br>
        <p>Unfortunately it is too late. </p><br>
        <p>You didn’t realize that the butterfly was your opponent this whole time. </p>
        <p>You can still see the butterfly in the distance, and it seems as if the flap of its wings has caused the snow
            avalanche.</p>
        <p>You try to run but you know there’s no escape. </p>
        <p>Let’s get ourselves into the corpse pose so that we’re ready and peaceful for when the wave of snow will take
            us away. </p>
        <p> To perform the Shavasana pose comfortably</p>
        <p> prepare a folded blanket or pillow for your head,</p>
        <p>sit on the mat legs are bent at the knees, feet are on the mat.</p>
        <p>First, lift your buttocks up, roll up your tailbone and place your buttocks on the mat.</p>
        <p>Now, bending your elbows slowly and lengthening your spine, lie flat on the mat.</p>
        <p>The blanket or pillow should be arranged so that they are at the line of your shoulders, so that the neck
            rests freely on the support. Put your hands under your head and pull out the skin, lower your head softly on
            the support.</p>
        <p>Place your hands along your torso, not too close, not too far, so that there is space between the side of
            your torso and your upper arm, allowing the air to flow freely through your groin.</p>
        <p>Now slowly, one leg after the other</p>
        <p>straighten the leg, pull to the back with your heel, straighten the other leg, legs are hip-width or the
            width of the mat.</p>
        <p>And relax.</p>
        <p>Your gaze should be at an angle of approximately 45 degrees,</p>
        <p>so that your eyes do not look too high (it means that your chin is sticking up and your head is flying
            backwards), and that your head is not too low and you are looking at your breastbone and your feet.</p>
        <p>Position your head so that it’s balanced, that you can breathe freely, and that your throat is soft.</p>
        <p>Then lower your eyelids on the exhale, close your eyes.</p>
        <p>And now bring all of your attention to the breath</p>
        <p>With each exhale, start relaxing your body more and more</p>
        <p>Relax your feet, relax your calves, relax your thighs, and as you exhale - release your buttocks</p>
        <p>Feel that your entire lower body is now soft and relaxed.</p>
        <p>Relax your belly</p>
        <p>Watch as with your exhale, your stomach becomes softer and softer and how it goes more downward.</p>
        <p>Let all the insides relax in your body, in your belly,</p>
        <p>relax your chest, relax your shoulders, let your shoulders gently drop down, feel your back and relax.</p>
        <p>Feel the touch between the mat and the skin on your back.</p>
        <p>With each exhalation, let the skin on your back become softer and sink into the mat.</p>
        <p>Relax your arms, forearms, hands, thumbs, relax your throat, feel that your throat is soft, your neck is
            relaxed, relax your tongue, jaw, cheeks, skin on your forehead, skin under your hair.</p>
        <p>Now feel that your body is soft and relaxed and your breath flows naturally and calmly.</p>
        <p>Watch your breath</p>
        <p>and notice if you can focus on observing your breathing and experience deep inner silence,</p>
        <p>or if there are any thoughts that come into your mind.</p>
        <p>If you notice that instead of watching your breath and focusing on your body, you are thinking about
            something, then notice the thought and let it drift away as clouds flow in the sky, let the thought flow and
            come back to observing the breath</p>
        <p>You can stay in this observation as long as you need to. </p><br>
        <p>To get out of the savasana position, (perhaps already in a different dimension) </p>
        <p> take a soft, deep breath in,</p>
        <p>slow, longer exhalation</p>
        <p>Move your toes slowly, carefully, one leg after the other, bend your knees, put your feet wide on the mat,
            heels outwards and bring your knees together.</p>
        <p>Your knees will drop down by themselves and come together.</p>
        <p>Place your hands on your stomach, when you feel ready by putting your hand under your head and leaving the
            other hand on your hip or moving it backwards, turn to the side, do not open your eyes yet, and inhale raise
            your eyelids, open your eyes and lift up with your hands on the mat, carefully, head at the end.</p><br>
        <p>What do you see now?</p><br>
        <p>Namaste.</p><br>
